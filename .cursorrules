# Cursor Rules for Episteme

## Documentation Policy

- **DO NOT** create documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested by the user
- **DO NOT** create README files proactively
- **DO NOT** create multiple similar documentation files (summaries, guides, checklists)
- **If documentation is needed**, consolidate into a SINGLE file with clear sections
- **Update existing docs** rather than creating new ones

## Code Quality

- Prioritize working code over documentation
- Use inline comments sparingly and only when complex logic requires explanation
- Let the code be self-documenting through good naming
- TypeScript types are better than JSDoc comments

## Preferences

- Focus on implementation, not documentation
- Ask before creating any *.md file
- When changes are complete, provide a brief summary in chat - don't write it to a file
