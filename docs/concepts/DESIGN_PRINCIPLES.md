# Episteme Design Principles

These principles guide every design decision. When we're stuck, when we're debating features, when we're unsure how to present something — we come back here.

These aren't generic ("be user-friendly"). They're opinionated. They reflect what makes Episteme different and help us make hard tradeoffs.

## 1. Structure Over Output

**We don't give you answers. We give you a map of what you need to address.**

A 6-page PDF is output. A Case with 3 inquiries, 2 resolved, 1 with unaddressed tensions — that's structure.

Output feels productive but often isn't. Structure enables real progress.

**This principle helps us decide:**
- Should we generate more content or better organize what exists? → Organize.
- Should we show a summary or show what questions remain? → Show the questions.
- Should this feature produce something or clarify something? → Clarify.

---

## 2. Visible Reasoning

**If you can't see it, you can't trust it.**

Every claim links to evidence. Every tension is surfaced, not hidden. Every conclusion can be traced back to its source.

Hidden reasoning creates false confidence. Visible reasoning creates grounded confidence.

**This principle helps us decide:**
- Should we blend sources into a smooth summary or show where they conflict? → Show conflict.
- Should we explain how we reached a conclusion? → Always.
- Should we simplify by hiding complexity? → Only if the complexity isn't decision-relevant.

## 3. Grounded Confidence, Not False Confidence

**We never make you feel more certain than you should be.**

We show you what's addressed and what's missing. Readiness is measurable, not a vague feeling. Blind spots are surfaced, not papered over.

An agreeable AI creates false confidence. We create grounded confidence — confidence you can defend because you can trace it.

**This principle helps us decide:**
- Should we reassure the user or challenge them? → Challenge when appropriate.
- Should we show "90% complete" or "2 tensions unresolved"? → The specific gaps.
- Should we validate the user's thinking or surface what they missed? → Surface what they missed.

## 4. Emergence Over Imposition

**Structure emerges from your thinking — we don't force you to fill out forms.**

Chat naturally → inquiries surface → evidence links → structure crystallizes.

Imposed structure feels like bureaucracy. Emergent structure feels like clarity.

**This principle helps us decide:**
- Should we require structure upfront or let it develop? → Let it develop.
- Should we ask users to categorize or should we suggest categories? → Suggest.
- Should this be a form or a conversation? → Conversation first, structure emerges.

---

## 5. Integration Over Accumulation

**Research that doesn't connect to your case is waste.**

Every document, every source, every piece of research should contribute to the structure — linked, not just stored. We don't let things pile up in a folder to be forgotten.

Accumulation feels productive. Integration actually is.

**This principle helps us decide:**
- Should we let users dump documents freely or encourage them to connect? → Encourage connection.
- Should research exist standalone or link to inquiries? → Link to inquiries.
- Should we show "5 documents uploaded" or "3 documents contributing to Case"? → Contributing.

---

## 6. Micro + Macro Working Together

**Chat is for thinking in the moment. Case is for reasoning over time.**

The companion reflects — "have you considered...?" The case structures — "here's what you need to address."

Neither alone is sufficient. Chat without case is just conversation. Case without chat is just forms.

**This principle helps us decide:**
- Should this feature live in chat or in the case? → Where does it serve its purpose?
- Should insights from chat persist? → Only if they contribute to the case.
- Should the case be editable through chat? → Yes, chat is an interface to the case.

## Using These Principles

### When designing a feature, ask:

1. Does this create **structure** or just output?
2. Is the reasoning **visible** and traceable?
3. Does this create **grounded confidence** or false confidence?
4. Does structure **emerge** or is it imposed?
5. Does this **integrate** into the case or just accumulate?
6. Is this **micro** (moment) or **macro** (persistent) — and are they connected?

### When debating a decision:

Reference the principle by name. "I think we should show the conflict between sources — that's *Visible Reasoning*." This creates shared vocabulary and faster decisions.

### When the principles conflict:

They shouldn't often, but when they do:
- **Grounded Confidence** usually wins — we never create false certainty
- **Structure Over Output** is foundational — if it doesn't create structure, question it
- **Emergence** can yield to **Integration** — we can prompt users to connect things

## What These Principles Are Not

- They're not UI patterns (those come later)
- They're not feature specs (those reference these)
- They're not negotiable per-feature (they apply everywhere)

They're the DNA of how Episteme feels and works.

## The Meta-Principle

**We help you think, not think for you.**

Every principle above serves this. Structure helps you think. Visible reasoning helps you evaluate. Grounded confidence means *your* confidence, not ours. Emergence respects your process. Integration makes your research useful. Micro + macro gives you the right tool for the moment.

ChatGPT thinks for you. Episteme helps you think.

That's the difference.
