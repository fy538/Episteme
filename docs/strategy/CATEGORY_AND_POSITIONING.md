# Category & Positioning

Where Episteme fits in the market, how to describe it, and the messaging hierarchy.

---

## Category Options

### Option A: "Decision Intelligence Platform"

> Episteme is a decision intelligence platform that turns uncertain exploration into grounded, evidence-backed decisions.

**Pros:**
- "Decision intelligence" is an emerging category (Gartner mentions it)
- Signals seriousness and enterprise value
- Differentiates clearly from "AI chatbot" or "research tool"

**Cons:**
- Category is nascent — requires education
- Could be confused with BI/analytics tools
- Sounds enterprise-heavy; may scare solo users

### Option B: "Epistemic Workspace"

> Episteme is an epistemic workspace — a structured environment for investigating decisions with AI-powered rigor.

**Pros:**
- "Epistemic" directly ties to the product name and core value
- "Workspace" is familiar (Notion, Slack, Figma)
- Signals that it's where work happens, not a utility

**Cons:**
- "Epistemic" requires explanation for non-academic users
- "Workspace" is overused in SaaS

### Option C: "Decision Copilot" (Recommended starting position)

> Episteme is a decision copilot that helps you investigate important decisions with evidence-based rigor.

**Pros:**
- "Copilot" is immediately understood (GitHub Copilot normalized it)
- Signals AI-powered assistance without replacement
- "Decision" scopes clearly what it's for
- Accessible to all three personas
- Low education burden

**Cons:**
- "Copilot" is becoming overused
- May undersell the platform depth

**Recommendation:** Start with "Decision Copilot" for initial positioning (low friction, immediately understood), then evolve toward "Decision Intelligence Platform" as the category matures and enterprise features develop.

## Positioning Statement

### Template

> **For** [target audience] **who** [situation/pain], **Episteme is a** [category] **that** [key benefit]. **Unlike** [alternative], **Episteme** [key differentiator].

### Recommended

> **For** professionals making high-stakes decisions **who** can't afford to rely on gut instinct or AI that agrees with everything, **Episteme is a decision copilot that** turns uncertain exploration into evidence-backed confidence. **Unlike** ChatGPT or research tools that dump information, **Episteme** tracks your assumptions, links evidence to claims, and won't let you skip to conclusions until the evidence supports them.

### Persona Variants

**For consultants:**
> Episteme gives you consulting-grade research infrastructure — triangulated evidence, source provenance, and structured briefs — without the manual overhead.

**For tech leads:**
> Episteme transforms team debates into structured investigations where assumptions are tracked, evidence is linked, and the decision record persists forever.

**For founders:**
> Episteme is the rigorous thinking partner you don't have — it challenges your assumptions, surfaces blind spots, and makes sure you're deciding based on evidence, not just confidence.

## Messaging Hierarchy

### Primary Message (1 sentence)

> **Investigate decisions with evidence-based rigor.**

This is the headline. Used in: hero section, social bios, elevator pitch.

### Supporting Pillars (3)

#### Pillar 1: "See your reasoning"
> Your assumptions, evidence, and tensions — all visible, all tracked, all connected.

Features: Signal extraction, assumption lifecycle, brief grounding indicators, contradiction detection.

#### Pillar 2: "From exploration to commitment"
> A structured journey from vague idea to confident decision, with gates that prevent premature commitment.

Features: Stage progression, section locking, readiness checklists, premortem, confidence calibration.

#### Pillar 3: "AI that challenges, not agrees"
> A thinking partner that asks hard questions, surfaces blind spots, and tells you when your confidence exceeds your evidence.

Features: Socratic companion, graph-aware reflection, objection system, "what would change your mind" resurface.

### Proof Points (per pillar)

**"See your reasoning":**
- Assumptions tracked from untested → confirmed/challenged/refuted
- Every claim linked to source evidence with credibility ratings
- Grounding status (empty/weak/moderate/strong/conflicted) per brief section
- 67 event types create complete audit trail

**"From exploration to commitment":**
- 4-stage progression: exploring → investigating → synthesizing → ready
- Recommendation section stays locked until evidence is sufficient
- Premortem forces failure imagination before commitment
- Decision criteria checklist ensures systematic evaluation

**"AI that challenges, not agrees":**
- Graph analyzer detects ungrounded assumptions, contradictions, evidence deserts
- Auto-created objections when evidence contradicts existing signals
- Confidence tracking shows where evidence and gut feeling diverge
- Socratic reflection informed by actual knowledge graph state

## Anti-Positioning: What Episteme Is NOT

Clarity on what we're not is as important as what we are:

| We are NOT | Why not |
|-----------|---------|
| A ChatGPT wrapper | Chat is an input channel, not the product |
| A research tool | Research is one stage in a multi-stage investigation workflow |
| A document editor | Briefs are evidence-grounded artifacts, not freeform docs |
| A project management tool | We track epistemic state (assumptions, evidence), not tasks |
| A knowledge base | We investigate decisions, not store reference knowledge |
| An analytics platform | We help humans reason, not crunch data |

## Naming & Language Guide

### Terms We Use

| Term | Meaning | Why This Word |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Case** | A decision investigation | Legal/consulting metaphor — implies rigor and thoroughness |
| **Inquiry** | A specific uncertainty to investigate | Signals curiosity and openness, not just "question" |
| **Signal** | An atomic observation from conversation | Radar metaphor — something your thinking is emitting |
| **Evidence** | A sourced fact linked to a claim | Legal/scientific rigor; not "data" or "info" |
| **Brief** | A structured synthesis document | Legal/consulting deliverable; implies quality standard |
| **Grounding** | How well-evidenced something is | Epistemic term — "grounded in reality" |
| **Scaffold** | Extracting structure from conversation | Construction metaphor — building framework from raw material |
| **Companion** | The meta-cognitive AI layer | Partner, not tool; observer, not controller |

### Terms We Avoid

| Avoid | Use Instead | Why |
|-------|------------|-----|
| "AI assistant" | "Decision copilot" or "thinking partner" | Avoid commoditization with every other AI tool |
| "Report" | "Brief" | Reports are read once; briefs are worked with |
| "Knowledge base" | "Case" | We're not storing knowledge; we're investigating decisions |
| "Task" | "Inquiry" | Tasks are done; inquiries are explored |
| "Insight" | "Signal" | Insights sound final; signals invite investigation |
| "Recommendation" | "Position" | Recommendations come from others; positions come from you |
