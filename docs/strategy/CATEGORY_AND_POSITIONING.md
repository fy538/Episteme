# Category & Positioning

Where Episteme fits in the market, how to describe it, and the messaging hierarchy.

## Category: Decision Investigation Platform

> **Episteme is a decision investigation platform — a system that helps you think through complex situations by extracting structure from your documents and conversations, tracking what you're assuming without proof, and helping you learn from the decisions you make.**

**Why this category:**
- It's honest about what the product does: not just mapping assumptions, but supporting the full decision lifecycle
- It differentiates from "research tool" (Perplexity, NotebookLM) and "AI chat" (ChatGPT with structure)
- It positions decision capture and outcome tracking as the strategic capstone, not an afterthought
- It's founder-friendly — immediate value without onboarding, with depth that grows over time

**The category evolution:**

| Stage | Category | What It Reflects |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| ~~V1 (past)~~ | ~~Assumption Mapper~~ | ~~Extract graph from docs, show contradictions~~ |
| **Current** | **Decision Investigation Platform** | Three-level architecture, CEAT extraction, decision capture, outcome tracking |
| Future | Decision Intelligence System | Autonomous agents, calibration, organizational decision memory |

## Positioning Statement

### Recommended (Founder-First)

> **For** founders making bets that could sink or scale their company **who** are working alone without a team to challenge their assumptions, **Episteme is a decision investigation platform that** helps you think through complex situations by building structure from your conversations and documents — surfacing contradictions, tracking assumptions, and recording decisions so you can learn from them. **Unlike** ChatGPT (which agrees), research tools (which summarize), or NotebookLM (which synthesizes), **Episteme** shows you where your information fights with itself, what you're betting on without proof, and — critically — helps you track whether your decisions turn out right.

**Why founder-first:** Founders feel the pain acutely. They decide alone. They can't afford bad bets. And Episteme's value is maximally obvious: structure + visibility + accountability in a form they can use immediately.

## Primary Message

> **See the state of your thinking.**

This is it. Not "make better decisions," not "eliminate bias," but the core promise: **make invisible thinking visible**. The message works across all stages of the product because structure and visibility are the foundation everything else builds on.

**Supporting messages that layer on:**

| When | Message |
|------|---------|
| Orientation (Project) | See what your documents cover — and what they miss |
| Exploration (Chat) | The companion that builds structure from your thinking |
| Investigation (Case) | Know what you're betting on without proof |
| Decision (Capture) | Record what you decided, and why |
| Learning (Outcome) | Come back in 60 days. Were you right? |

---

## Supporting Pillars

### Pillar 1: "Structure Emerges From Thinking"
> You don't fill out forms. You talk. The system builds decision trees, surfaces assumptions, and detects contradictions — from your words and your documents.

Features: Organic companion, CEAT extraction, hierarchical document clustering, conversational editing.

### Pillar 2: "See What You're Betting On"
> Your documents probably disagree on something important. You're probably assuming things you've never tested. The system shows you what.

Features: Cross-document contradiction detection, assumption lifecycle tracking, absence inference, blind spot analysis.

### Pillar 3: "Decisions You Can Learn From"
> Record what you decided and why. Check back in 30/60/90 days. Over time, build a personal track record of decision quality.

Features: DecisionRecord capture, outcome check-ins, confidence tracking, personal decision journal.

## One-Liner Variations

| Context | One-Liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Website hero** | See the state of your thinking. |
| **Product Hunt** | Upload your docs. See where they agree, fight, and stay silent. Then decide — and track whether you were right. |
| **Founder pitch** | The difference between scattered research and structured thinking — with a decision journal that helps you learn. |
| **Twitter/Social** | Where founders go to see what they're actually betting on. |
| **Email hook** | Other tools summarize your docs. We show you where they contradict — and help you decide what to do about it. |
| **Investor pitch** | The only tool that helps you make decisions *and* learn from them. |

---

## Anti-Positioning: What Episteme Is NOT

| We are NOT | Why not |
|-----------|---------|
| A ChatGPT wrapper | Chat is input; structured investigation is the product |
| A research tool | We don't gather info; we structure what you have and track what it means |
| NotebookLM with features | We're a different category: investigation + decision, not synthesis |
| A document editor | We don't help you write; we help you think |
| A project management tool | We track thinking and decisions, not tasks |
| A knowledge base | We investigate, not store |
| An analytics platform | We help *you* reason, not process data |

## Category Evolution Roadmap

### Current: Decision Investigation Platform (Solo Founder)
- **Three-level architecture**: Project (orientation) → Chat (exploration) → Case (investigation)
- **CEAT framework**: Claims, Evidence, Assumptions, Tensions — extracted and tracked
- **Decision capture**: Record decisions, set outcome check dates, build a personal decision journal
- **Founder-first persona**: Deciding alone, highest stakes, natural evangelists
- **Validate**: Do users complete cases? Do they record decisions? Do they come back for outcome checks?

### Next: Decision Copilot (Individual, Multi-Persona)
- Add readiness tracking + evidence sufficiency gates
- Expand to consultant and tech lead personas
- Output flexibility (memos, decks, ARDs)
- RAG citations for source-grounded responses

### Later: Decision Intelligence System (Autonomous + Calibration)
- Autonomous agent governed by same epistemic stack proven in human usage
- Confidence calibration: "Users with your profile are right X% of the time at this confidence level"
- Premium tier
- **Prerequisite**: Prove epistemic stack improves actual decisions (requires outcome data)

### Future: Decision Intelligence Workspace (Team)
- Multi-player investigation
- Organizational decision memory
- Integration with Jira, Notion, Slack

## Lesson From Granola: One Opinionated Decision

Granola (AI meeting notes, $250M valuation) operates in a market far more crowded than ours — Otter, Fireflies, Fathom, Zoom AI, Teams AI, Google Meet AI. They won with **one opinionated architectural decision**: no bot joins the meeting. Audio is captured at the device level. No notification. No "Recording Bot has joined." This single decision unlocked executive meetings, board conversations, and sensitive negotiations — an entire market segment every bot-based competitor is structurally locked out of.

Key lessons for Episteme:

1. **One architectural decision can be the entire differentiator.** For us, that's **decision capture + outcome tracking**: the full lifecycle from "what should I decide?" to "was I right?" No other tool in the market does this.
2. **UX is the moat, not the LLM.** Granola's founder says this explicitly. Everyone uses the same models. The differentiation is interaction design. Our organic companion, CEAT extraction, and decision journal are UX, not AI capability.
3. **Cut features ruthlessly.** Granola built real-time AI augmentation during meetings. Users stopped paying attention to conversations. They cut 50% of built features. The constraint became the product identity. We should ask: which of our layers produce 90% of the value?
4. **Surgical beachhead, then expand.** Granola started with VCs and founders — tiny market, highest pain, natural evangelists, were literally the investors. Our founder-first strategy follows the same logic.
