Where Episteme fits in the market, how to describe it, and the messaging hierarchy.

## [V1 SCOPE] Category: Assumption Mapper / Epistemic Orientation Tool

The honest, precise category for v1:

> **Episteme is an assumption mapper — a tool that makes your thinking visible by extracting claims from documents, detecting where they contradict, and showing you what you're betting on without proof.**

**Why this category for v1:**
- It's honest about scope (not a full decision platform yet)
- It differentiates from "research tool" (Perplexity) and "decision copilot" (ChatGPT with structure)
- It's founder-friendly — immediate value without onboarding
- "Assumption mapper" is concrete; you understand what it does

**Better one-liners for v1:**

| Context | One-Liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Hero section** | See the state of your thinking. |
| **Product Hunt** | Upload your docs. See where they agree, fight, and stay silent. |
| **Founder pitch** | The difference between scattered research and structured thinking. |
| **Social bio** | Where founders go to see what they're actually betting on. |

---

## [FUTURE SCOPE] Category Evolution (Post-V1)

### Near-term (Post-V1, with readiness + plan):
**"Decision Copilot"** — AI-powered investigation with evidence-tracked reasoning.

### Medium-term (with multi-player, output skills):
**"Decision Intelligence Platform"** — Organizational decision-making with memory, audit trails, and governance.

### For now in v1:
Focus on **"Assumption Mapper"** or **"Epistemic Orientation Tool"** — honest about what you're building, maximally differentiated from chat.

## Positioning Statement [V1 SCOPE]

### Recommended (V1 — Founder-First)

> **For** founders making bets that could sink or scale their company **who** are working alone without a team to challenge their assumptions, **Episteme is an assumption mapper that** makes your thinking visible by extracting claims from documents, detecting contradictions, and showing you what you're betting on without proof. **Unlike** ChatGPT (which agrees) or research tools (which summarize), **Episteme** shows you where your information fights with itself and what you'll need to know before you decide.

**Why founder-first:** Founders feel the pain acutely. They decide alone. They can't afford bad bets. And Episteme's value is maximally obvious: structure + visibility in a form they can use immediately.

## Primary Message [V1]

> **See the state of your thinking.**

This is it. Not "make better decisions," not "eliminate bias," but the core promise: **make invisible thinking visible**.

---

## Supporting Pillars [V1]

### Pillar 1: "Contradiction Detection"
> Your documents probably disagree on something important. Most tools hide it. We show it.

Features: Cross-document analysis, visual contradiction marking, source-specific claims.

### Pillar 2: "Assumption Surfacing"
> You're betting on things you've never proven. The system shows you what.

Features: Assumption extraction, distinction between "claimed" vs. "evidenced," visual grounding indicators.

### Pillar 3: "Structured Thinking"
> Scattered research becomes a navigable graph you can explore, question, and refine.

Features: Graph visualization, conversational editing, interactive exploration.

## One-Liner Variations [V1]

| Context | One-Liner |
|---------|-----------|
| **Website hero** | See the state of your thinking. |
| **Product Hunt** | Upload your docs. See where they agree, fight, and stay silent. |
| **Founder pitch** | The difference between scattered research and structured thinking. |
| **Twitter/Social** | Where founders go to see what they're actually betting on. |
| **Email hook** | Other tools summarize your docs. We show you where they contradict. |

---

## Anti-Positioning [V1]: What Episteme Is NOT

| We are NOT | Why not |
|-----------|---------|
| A ChatGPT wrapper | Chat is input; the graph is the product |
| A research tool | We don't gather info; we structure what you have |
| A document editor | We don't help you write; we help you think |
| A project management tool | We track thinking, not tasks |
| A knowledge base | We investigate, not store |
| An analytics platform | We help *you* reason, not process data |

## Category Evolution Roadmap

### V1: Assumption Mapper (Solo Founder)
- **Dump & Discover**: Zero-intent entry point — upload docs, get an evidence map showing agreements, contradictions, gaps, and hidden assumptions (see [Product Funnel](./PRODUCT_FUNNEL.md))
- **Investigation workflow**: The core structured decision journey for founders
- **Founder-first persona**: Market Entry, High-Stakes Decision Quality skills as defaults
- PLG-friendly positioning — no onboarding friction for Dump & Discover
- **Validate**: Do users convert from evidence map → investigation? Do they complete cases and come back?

### Next: Decision Copilot (Post-V1 — Individual, Multi-Persona)
- Add readiness tracking + evidence sufficiency gates
- Expand to consultant and tech lead personas
- Output flexibility (memos, decks, ARDs)

### Later: Decision Agent (Post-V1 — Autonomous Investigation)
- Autonomous agent governed by same epistemic stack proven in human usage
- Premium tier
- **Prerequisite**: Prove epistemic stack improves actual decisions

### Future: Decision Intelligence Workspace & Platform (Post-V1 — Team)
- Multi-player investigation
- Organizational decision memory
- Integration with Jira, Notion, Slack

## Lesson From Granola: One Opinionated Decision

Granola (AI meeting notes, $250M valuation) operates in a market far more crowded than ours — Otter, Fireflies, Fathom, Zoom AI, Teams AI, Google Meet AI. They won with **one opinionated architectural decision**: no bot joins the meeting. Audio is captured at the device level. No notification. No "Recording Bot has joined." This single decision unlocked executive meetings, board conversations, and sensitive negotiations — an entire market segment every bot-based competitor is structurally locked out of.

Key lessons for Episteme:

1. **One architectural decision can be the entire differentiator.** For us, that's the delta view: "what does this document change about your decision?" vs. every other tool's "here's what's in your document."
2. **UX is the moat, not the LLM.** Granola's founder says this explicitly. Everyone uses the same models. The differentiation is interaction design. Our cascade, delta view, and section locking are UX, not AI capability.
3. **Cut features ruthlessly.** Granola built real-time AI augmentation during meetings. Users stopped paying attention to conversations. They cut 50% of built features. The constraint became the product identity. We should ask: which of our 10 metacognitive layers produce 90% of the value?
4. **Surgical beachhead, then expand.** Granola started with VCs and founders — tiny market, highest pain, natural evangelists, were literally the investors. Our founder-first strategy follows the same logic.

See [Product Funnel](./PRODUCT_FUNNEL.md) for the full strategic vision.

## Naming & Language Guide [V1]

### Core Terms (V1)

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Graph** | Your thinking made visible: nodes (beliefs, claims, evidence) + edges (relationships) |
| **Node** | An atomic unit: assumption, claim, or evidence |
| **Edge** | A relationship: supports, contradicts, relates-to |
| **Assumption** | Something you believe without proof (yet) |
| **Evidence** | Sourced facts from documents |
| **Grounding** | Whether something is proven or assumed |
| **Contradiction** | Where two claims or documents disagree |
| **Delta** | What changed when you added new information |

### Terms to Avoid (V1)

| Avoid | Use Instead | Why |
|-------|------------|-----|
| "Insight" | "Assumption" or "Contradiction" | Be specific |
| "Summary" | "Evidence Map" or "Graph" | We diagnose, not summarize |
| "Tool" | "Episteme" or "Assumption Mapper" | Avoid generic framing |
| "Report" | (Post-V1 only) | V1 outputs graphs, not documents |
