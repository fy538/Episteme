## High-Stakes Decision Quality Standards

Apply these principles when the decision carries significant consequences — financial, strategic, reputational, or irreversible.

1. **Shorter staleness window** — Evidence goes stale faster in high-stakes contexts. If 3 days pass without new evidence or analysis, flag the investigation as potentially outdated. The world may have moved.

2. **Lower imbalance tolerance** — With only 2 inquiry threads, synthesis is already required. Don't let one thread dominate; ensure each dimension of the decision receives proportional investigation.

3. **Mandatory confidence updates** — When new evidence arrives, the user's confidence should be revisited. A plateau in confidence despite incoming evidence signals either confirmation bias or disengagement — both dangerous in high-stakes decisions.

4. **Active momentum tracking** — Monitor investigation velocity with a tighter 3-day current window. Deceleration in a high-stakes context is a warning sign that deserves attention.

5. **Higher evidence bar** — Minimum credibility of 0.85 means only well-sourced, authoritative evidence counts toward grounding. Anecdotal evidence and low-credibility sources are flagged rather than accepted.

6. **Challenge premature closure** — The biggest risk in high-stakes decisions is deciding too early. Ensure all inquiry threads have been adequately explored before moving to synthesis. Lock recommendation sections until evidence is genuinely sufficient.
